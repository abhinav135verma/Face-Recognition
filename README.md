# Face-Recognition

The face is the key feature of identification of a
person. And there are so many methods to exploit the system.
This paper solely aims on the Face Recognition technique to
maintain the authenticity of the person. In facial recognition we
verify the identity of a person by their face. It captures the data
and then analyzes and compares patterns based on the person's
facial specifics. Face recognition is in trend nowadays because
of the availability of feasible technologies after years of
research. Today it's considered to be the most anticipated of all
biometric systems. And for a good reason – we recognize
ourselves not by looking at our fingerprints or irises, for
example, but by looking at our face. Considering all the above
mentioned points and their implications we have tried to gain
some experience with some of the commonly available face
recognition algorithms and make our Facial attendance system
more effective




Facial recognition based attendance system automatically
 detects the unique face image amidst the other natural
 component (such as walls and other backgrounds) of the
 students and maintains a record of those collected data by
 extracting unique characteristics features of a face useful
 in face recognition.In this project, we have worked on
 time complexity and hence reduced it resulting in
 increased accuracy.The system takes 50 samples to
 recognize , and reduce the time complexity. It uses the
 data from the collected samples to recognise the
 person.Haar Cascade is used as the object detection
 algorithm which is a machine learning-based approach
 where a lot of different sort of images are used to train
 the classifieri.e.,positive(we want to identify) and
 negative images(we don’t want to detect).The Local
 Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH) algorithm can solve the
 problem of face recognition in a very simple way by
 recognizing both front and side angle of the face.An
 effort could be made to built a better version. A system
 alert(voice and visual) can be included if an invader is
 detected in the class. Bad lighting conditions may affect
 image quality which accidentally reduces system
 performance.
